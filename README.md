**1. I created a new Java project in eclipse with name Lab8 and created a package inside it with name mypackage**

**2.I then created a class with name Boa and then added the given code inside it**

**3.Then I created a JUnit test file for the Boa Class with name BoaTest**

**4.Then I modified the setUp method to initialize the variables**

**5.Then I also implemented tests for the given two functions testIsHealthy() and testFitsInCage()**

It is not necessary to develop tests for both ken and jen objects in order to test the fitsInCage() method because the function is the same for both, and the results of test cases depend only on whether the specified length is greater than, less than, or equal to the actual length of the object.In both situations, the behaviour will be comparable.

**6.Then I ran the Junit test file and all the tests are passed.There are no red bars in the output**

It can be seen that 2 out of 2 test cases have been passed.

**7.Then I added a new method to the Boa class with name lenghtInInches() to get the length in inches**

As the length of the Boa is given in feet, to convert it into inches, I had multiplied length with 12 and returned the value.

**8.Then I wrote another test case for this new method and ran the 3 test cases together**

Thus, test cases have been written for the given Boa class and all the three methods have been tested with required Junit test cases.
